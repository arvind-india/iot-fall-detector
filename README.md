# IOT-Monitoring-Helper
Used Nodemcu (Esp8266) along with the sensors Mpu6050 (accelerometer and gyroscope), and Bmp180 (pressure) for detecting the context of the application user, and also the API of IFTT for sending messages to pre-registered users for test cases, if need more info please contact me.
